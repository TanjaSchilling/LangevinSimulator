Possible developments for future versions


Version number: 
We use semantic versioning (<https://semver.org/>). 
The version number is mentioned in doc/Doxyfile and in README.md. 
It could be worth to store the version number in just one place, like the Makefile. 


The Python module should be adopted to have the same syntax as the C++ library. 


For the Python module it could be of interest to make a python package, 
as explained, e.g., on: 
https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/
